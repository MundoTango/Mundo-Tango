## 📚 **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **Critical Insights**

1. **Agents must become SMEs BEFORE implementation** - Training agents on documentation and industry standards first ensures they understand their domain deeply

2. **Domain mapping is crucial** - Some agents (AGENT_6 routing, FEATURE_TEXT_CHAT, FEATURE_VIBE_CODING) received 0 documents due to insufficient domain keyword mapping. Need to improve domain extraction.

3. **Industry standards provide quality baseline** - Loading standards from Amazon, Apple, OpenAI, Anthropic gives agents concrete best practices to follow

4. **Documentation indexing scales well** - 313 files scanned, 396 mappings created in <5 minutes

5. **Agent hierarchy matters** - Page → Feature → Element hierarchy enables proper ownership and self-healing

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Code indexing** - Phase 2 code analysis not yet implemented (agent_code_knowledge table empty)
2. **Domain keyword expansion** - Need better keyword detection for domains like "messaging", "code_generation", "visual_editor"
3. **Proficiency tracking** - All agents at 0% proficiency because they haven't started "studying" the indexed docs yet
4. **Quiz/certification system** - Need mechanism to quiz agents and update proficiency scores
5. **Practical application tracking** - Need to track when agents apply their knowledge and learn from feedback
