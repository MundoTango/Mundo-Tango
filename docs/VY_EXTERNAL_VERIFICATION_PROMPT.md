- Payments working (Stripe test mode)
- Real-time chat and notifications
- Admin dashboard and analytics
- Security and GDPR compliance
- 115 E2E tests passing

**What's Blocked (4 API Keys Needed):**
1. **Email service (Resend)** - User verification, password resets
2. **Media storage (Cloudinary)** - Image/video uploads (verify free tier)
3. **God Level: D-ID** - AI video avatars ($18 or $35/mo - you'll verify)
4. **God Level: ElevenLabs** - Voice cloning ($22/mo - you'll verify)

**Timeline to 100%:**
- **Basic Launch:** 20 minutes (just email + secure session)
- **Revenue Launch:** 25 minutes (add Stripe production keys)
- **God Level Launch:** 1h 30min (add D-ID + ElevenLabs after your verification)

---

### 🎯 Why Your Verification Matters

You're verifying the 4 external services that enable:

1. **Resend** - Without email, users can't verify accounts or reset passwords → Platform unusable
2. **Cloudinary** - Without media storage, users can't upload dance photos/videos → Core feature broken
3. **D-ID** - Without video avatars, God Level tier can't launch → $4,950/month revenue blocked
4. **ElevenLabs** - Without voice cloning, God Level incomplete → Premium value proposition weakened

**Your verification ensures:**
- Accurate pricing (no surprise costs)
- Free tier limits sufficient for MVP
- Features match our implementation
- Production-ready for launch

**Impact:** Your 45 minutes of verification work enables a $4,950/month revenue tier to launch confidently! 🚀
