1. INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS MB.MD?
=======================================================================

MB.MD is a methodology for building complex software systems with:
✅ Maximum parallelism (work on multiple layers simultaneously)
✅ Deep understanding (recursive exploration of dependencies)
✅ High quality (critical evaluation at every step)

**Origin**: Developed for Mundo Tango platform to coordinate 1,255+ AI agents
working in parallel across 5 workstreams while maintaining quality.

**Core Principle**: "Work like a team of 100 experts, not one person doing
tasks sequentially."

3. WHEN TO USE MB.MD
=======================================================================

✅ USE MB.MD WHEN:
- Building complex features with multiple layers (DB + API + UI)
- Working on systems with many interdependencies
- Need to maximize development velocity
- Quality cannot be compromised
- Working with AI agents or large teams

❌ DON'T USE MB.MD WHEN:
- Making trivial one-line changes
- Fixing simple typos
- Working on completely isolated features
- Learning a new technology (sequential is better for learning)

=======================================================================
4. EXECUTION PATTERNS
=======================================================================

PATTERN 1: FEATURE DEVELOPMENT (Most Common)

Step 1: SIMULTANEOUSLY launch all layers
  ├─ Database: Create schema/migrations
  ├─ Backend: Write API routes
  ├─ Frontend: Build UI components
  ├─ Tests: Write test cases
  └─ Docs: Document the feature

Step 2: RECURSIVELY explore dependencies
  ├─ Read existing code patterns
  ├─ Check database conventions
  ├─ Review authentication flow
  └─ Understand state management

Step 3: CRITICALLY review and test
  ├─ Call architect for review
  ├─ Run end-to-end tests
  ├─ Fix all LSP errors
  └─ Verify edge cases

---

PATTERN 2: BUG FIX

Step 1: RECURSIVELY understand the bug
  ├─ Read error logs
  ├─ Trace code execution
  ├─ Identify root cause
  └─ Check related systems

Step 2: SIMULTANEOUSLY fix all affected layers
  ├─ Fix database query
  ├─ Update API logic
  ├─ Update UI to handle edge case
  └─ Add test to prevent regression

Step 3: CRITICALLY verify the fix
  ├─ Run tests
  ├─ Check for similar bugs elsewhere
  ├─ Get architect approval
  └─ Document the issue

---

PATTERN 3: REFACTORING

Step 1: RECURSIVELY analyze current state
  ├─ Map all dependencies
  ├─ Identify problem areas
  ├─ Plan migration path
  └─ List breaking changes

Step 2: SIMULTANEOUSLY update all layers
  ├─ Update types/interfaces
  ├─ Migrate database schema
  ├─ Update API contracts
  └─ Update UI components

Step 3: CRITICALLY test everything
  ├─ Run full test suite
  ├─ Manual QA testing
  ├─ Performance testing
  └─ Architect review

=======================================================================
5. ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID
=======================================================================

❌ ANTI-PATTERN 1: Sequential Waterfall
BAD:
  1. Design database
  2. WAIT for approval
  3. Build API
  4. WAIT for testing
  5. Build UI
  6. WAIT for review

GOOD:
  1. Design database + Build API + Build UI (simultaneously)
  2. Test all layers together
  3. Get one comprehensive review

---

❌ ANTI-PATTERN 2: Shallow Implementation
BAD:
  - Copy-paste code without understanding
  - Skip reading related files
  - Ignore existing patterns

GOOD:
  - Read surrounding code (recursively)
  - Understand why patterns exist
  - Follow established conventions

---

❌ ANTI-PATTERN 3: Ship First, Fix Later
BAD:
  - Mark complete without testing
  - Skip architect review to save time
  - Ignore TypeScript errors
  - "I'll fix it later"

GOOD:
  - Test before marking complete
  - Get architect approval
  - Zero LSP errors required
  - Fix issues immediately

---

❌ ANTI-PATTERN 4: Over-Engineering
BAD:
  - Build features user didn't request
  - Add "nice to have" functionality
  - Create unnecessary abstractions

GOOD:
  - Build exactly what was requested
  - Keep it simple
  - Add abstractions only when needed

=======================================================================
6. TRAINING GUIDE FOR AI AGENTS
=======================================================================

TEACHING MB.MD TO AI AGENTS:

Phase 1: Understanding
  - Show this document
  - Explain each pillar with examples
  - Demonstrate parallel tool calls
  - Practice with simple features

Phase 2: Practice
  - Start with Tier 1 features (critical path)
  - Monitor execution (are they working in parallel?)
  - Provide feedback when sequential patterns appear
  - Reward simultaneous execution

Phase 3: Mastery
  - Graduate to complex multi-layer features
  - Handle 5+ parallel workstreams
  - Self-verify quality without prompting
  - Train other agents

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
✅ Executes tasks in parallel (not sequentially)
✅ Explores dependencies before building
✅ Calls architect without being reminded
✅ Zero LSP errors in final code
✅ Tests work before marking complete

=======================================================================
7. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
=======================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Deployment Automation Feature

❌ SEQUENTIAL APPROACH (8 hours):
  Hour 1-2: Design database schema
  Hour 3-4: Build backend API
  Hour 5-6: Build frontend UI
  Hour 7: Write tests
  Hour 8: Get review, fix issues

✅ MB.MD APPROACH (3 hours):
  Hour 1: Launch ALL layers simultaneously
    - Create deployments table
    - Write /api/deployments routes
    - Build DeployButton component
    - Set up GitHub integration
    - Write test cases
  
  Hour 2: Recursive exploration
    - Read existing Supabase patterns
    - Check authentication flow
    - Review GitHub Octokit docs
    - Test locally
  
  Hour 3: Critical review
    - Call architect
    - Run end-to-end tests
    - Fix all issues
    - Mark complete

RESULT: 3 hours vs 8 hours (62% faster) ✅

---

EXAMPLE 2: Bug Fix (Like Toggle Race Condition)

❌ SEQUENTIAL APPROACH:
  1. Fix useToggleLike hook
  2. Test it
  3. Realize UI also needs update
  4. Update FeedPage
  5. Test again
  6. Realize cache needs update
  7. Update cache logic
  8. Test again

✅ MB.MD APPROACH:
  1. RECURSIVELY trace the bug:
     - UserLike query can be undefined
     - Both posts cache AND user-like cache need updates
     - FeedPage needs to pass current state
  
  2. SIMULTANEOUSLY fix all layers:
     - Update useToggleLike (dual-cache)
     - Update FeedPage (pass state)
     - Update types if needed
  
  3. CRITICALLY verify:
     - Call architect
     - Test rapid clicks
     - Verify counts stay accurate
     - Mark complete

RESULT: One comprehensive fix vs iterative patches ✅

=======================================================================
8. SELF-VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=======================================================================

Before marking ANY task as complete, verify:

□ SIMULTANEOUSLY:
  □ Did I work on multiple layers at once?
  □ Did I use parallel tool calls?
  □ Did I avoid sequential bottlenecks?

□ RECURSIVELY:
  □ Did I read related code first?
  □ Do I understand why this pattern exists?
  □ Did I check dependencies?
  □ Do I know how this fits in the bigger picture?

□ CRITICALLY:
  □ Did I call architect for review?
  □ Are there zero LSP errors?
  □ Did I test the feature end-to-end?
  □ Does the application run without errors?
  □ Did I check for edge cases?
  □ Did I fix ALL issues found?

□ DOCUMENTATION:
  □ Did I update replit.md if needed?
  □ Are data-testid attributes added?
  □ Did I follow coding conventions?

□ FINAL CHECK:
  □ Would I ship this to production?
  □ Am I proud of this code quality?
  □ Is this the best I can do?

If ANY checkbox is unchecked: NOT READY ❌
If ALL checkboxes checked: READY TO SHIP ✅

=======================================================================
🎯 SUMMARY
=======================================================================

MB.MD = Maximum velocity + Deep understanding + High quality

**The Three Pillars:**
1. 🔄 SIMULTANEOUSLY: Work in parallel, not sequential
2. 🔍 RECURSIVELY: Explore deeply before building
3. ⚡ CRITICALLY: Test everything, call architect, zero errors

**Result**: 
- 60%+ faster development
- Higher quality code
- Fewer bugs
- Better architecture
- Happier developers

**Remember**: 
Work like a team of experts simultaneously exploring and critically 
evaluating every decision, not one person doing tasks one at a time.
