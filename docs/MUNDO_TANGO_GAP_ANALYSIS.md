# MUNDO TANGO - COMPLETE GAP ANALYSIS
**Date:** November 17, 2025  
**Analyzed By:** Replit Agent  
**Source:** Ultimate Series Parts 2-10 + Complete + MB_MD_FINAL_BUILD_PLAN.md

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem:** Subagents reported "47 pages built" but only homepage is visible to user.  
**Root Cause:** Claims without verification, missing implementation details, no comprehensive roadmap followed.  
**Solution:** Systematic gap analysis + mb.md parallel rebuild with verification gates.
