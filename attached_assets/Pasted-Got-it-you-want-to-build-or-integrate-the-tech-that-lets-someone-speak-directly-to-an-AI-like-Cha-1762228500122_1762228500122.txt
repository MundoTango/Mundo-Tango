Got it — you want to build or integrate the tech that lets someone speak directly to an AI (like ChatGPT’s voice conversations), not just use it.

Here’s how that actually works under the hood 👇

🧠 Core Tech Stack for Real-Time Voice Conversations

1. Speech-to-Text (STT) — Turning speech into words

This is what listens to you.
Options:
	•	OpenAI Realtime API (fastest integration — it’s what powers ChatGPT voice mode)
	•	Whisper API (OpenAI’s speech recognition model — free or low cost, but not real-time)
	•	Google Speech-to-Text, Deepgram, or AssemblyAI for alternatives

💡 If you use OpenAI’s Realtime API, it handles both listening and responding live in one WebRTC session.

2. Text-to-Speech (TTS) — Making the AI talk

Converts the model’s reply into a natural voice.

Options:
	•	OpenAI TTS API (uses the same high-quality voices as ChatGPT app)
	•	ElevenLabs, Microsoft Azure Neural TTS, or Amazon Polly

You can stream audio back to the user as it’s generated.

3. AI Brain (the conversation engine)

This is your large language model — e.g.:
	•	gpt-4-turbo or gpt-5 via OpenAI’s API
	•	You can also use other LLMs (Claude, Gemini, or local models via Ollama)

The model receives the user’s transcribed text and returns the response text.

4. Real-Time Connection

To make it conversational (no lag, natural flow):
	•	Use WebRTC or WebSockets for low-latency streaming.
	•	The OpenAI Realtime API handles this natively — one connection for audio in/out + text messages.

⸻

5. Frontend / UI Layer

Depending on what you’re building:
	•	Web: use Web Audio API + WebRTC
	•	Mobile: native mic/audio APIs (AVAudioEngine for iOS, MediaRecorder for Android)
	•	Desktop app: use Electron or a native bridge for mic access

Would you like me to:
	1.	🧰 Show you exact example code (JavaScript or Python) for a real-time voice AI using OpenAI’s Realtime API?
	2.	🎨 Or design a custom setup for your Mundo Tango / Life CEO system — where users can literally talk to their AI assistant?

Which direction should I take it?
