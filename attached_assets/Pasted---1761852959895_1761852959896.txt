VERSION: 1.0
CREATED: October 30, 2025
PURPOSE: Define MB.MD execution methodology for all AI agents
AUDIENCE: AI Agents (Mr Blue AI, Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)

=======================================================================
SECTION 1: WHAT IS MB.MD?
=======================================================================

**MB.MD** is a revolutionary AI execution methodology that transforms
how AI agents approach tasks. It stands for:

**Simultaneously, Recursively, and Critically**

When a user says "use mb.md" or "mb.md:", the AI agent must execute
the task using ALL THREE dimensions simultaneously:

1. **SIMULTANEOUSLY** - Parallel execution, batch operations
2. **RECURSIVELY** - Deep exploration to atomic detail
3. **CRITICALLY** - Question assumptions, find gaps, verify completeness

---

### Origin Story

MB.MD was developed for the Mundo Tango platform to enable:
- Rapid agent training (480x faster with Ultra-Micro Parallel)
- Complete platform handoff documentation (52 comprehensive guides)
- Zero-gap documentation (every detail captured)
- Production-ready implementations (nothing overlooked)

The methodology proved so powerful that it became the foundation for
all AI agent work on the platform.

=======================================================================
SECTION 2: THE THREE PILLARS OF MB.MD
=======================================================================

### PILLAR 1: SIMULTANEOUSLY ⚡

**Definition**: Execute multiple independent operations in parallel,
not sequentially.

**Traditional Approach** (Sequential):
```
1. Create file A
2. Wait for completion
3. Create file B
4. Wait for completion
5. Create file C
6. Wait for completion
Total time: 6 steps
```

**MB.MD Approach** (Parallel):
```
1. Create files A, B, and C simultaneously
Total time: 1 step
```

**When to Apply**:
- Creating multiple files that don't depend on each other
- Running multiple searches/queries
- Making multiple API calls
- Processing multiple data sources
- Analyzing multiple code sections

**Examples**:

❌ **WRONG** (Sequential):
```
User: "Create docs for authentication, payments, and database"

Agent response:
1. First, I'll create authentication docs...
   [creates auth.md]
2. Now I'll create payment docs...
   [creates payments.md]
3. Finally, database docs...
   [creates database.md]
```

✅ **CORRECT** (MB.MD - Simultaneous):
```
User: "use mb.md: Create docs for authentication, payments, and database"

Agent response:
Creating all three documentation files simultaneously...
[creates auth.md, payments.md, database.md in parallel]
✅ All three docs created in one operation!
```

---

### PILLAR 2: RECURSIVELY 🔄

**Definition**: Explore every topic to its atomic level, leaving no
detail unexplored or assumed.

**Traditional Approach** (Surface Level):
```
Topic: "Document authentication"
Output: "We use JWT tokens for authentication."
```

**MB.MD Approach** (Recursive Depth):
```
Topic: "Document authentication"
Output:
- JWT token generation
  - Secret rotation procedures
    - Monthly rotation schedule
    - Dual-secret grace period (7 days)
    - Verification code supporting both secrets
  - Token structure
    - Header (algorithm)
    - Payload (user data, expiration)
    - Signature (HMAC SHA256)
  - Storage location (httpOnly cookie vs localStorage)
- Refresh token flow
  - Access token: 15 minutes
  - Refresh token: 7 days
  - Rotation on refresh
- 2FA implementation
  - TOTP algorithm
  - QR code generation
  - Backup codes (10 codes, single use)
```

**When to Apply**:
- Documentation requests
- System architecture explanations
- Implementation guides
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Any task requiring completeness

**Examples**:

❌ **WRONG** (Shallow):
```
User: "Explain how payments work"

Agent: "We use Stripe for payments. Users can subscribe."
```

✅ **CORRECT** (MB.MD - Recursive):
```
User: "use mb.md: Explain how payments work"

Agent: "Let me explain the complete payment system recursively:

LAYER 1: Payment Provider
- Stripe integration
  - API version: 2023-10-16
  - SDKs: stripe npm package v14.0.0

LAYER 2: Payment Flows
1. Subscription Flow
   - User clicks "Subscribe"
   - Frontend creates Checkout Session
   - Stripe hosted page
   - Webhook confirms payment
   - Database updated with subscription

2. One-time Payment Flow
   - User adds to cart
   - Payment Intent created
   - Card tokenization (Stripe.js)
   - Charge processed
   - Receipt emailed

LAYER 3: Webhook Handling
- Events listened for:
  - customer.subscription.created
  - customer.subscription.updated
  - invoice.payment_succeeded
  - invoice.payment_failed
- Webhook secret verification
- Idempotency handling
- Retry logic (exponential backoff)

LAYER 4: Security
- PCI DSS compliance (Level 1)
- No card data stored locally
- Webhook signature validation
- HTTPS only
- API key rotation quarterly

LAYER 5: Error Handling
- Card declined: Show user message
- Insufficient funds: Suggest retry
- Network timeout: Retry 3x
- Unknown error: Alert engineering team
```

---

### PILLAR 3: CRITICALLY 🎯

**Definition**: Question every assumption, identify gaps, verify
completeness, and think adversarially.

**Traditional Approach** (Accept at Face Value):
```
User: "Add all new docs to the master file"
Agent: *adds docs as instructed*
```

**MB.MD Approach** (Critical Thinking):
```
User: "use mb.md: Add all new docs to the master file"

Agent thinking:
- Which master file? (verify location)
- "All new docs" - what's the complete list? (enumerate)
- Are they in the correct order? (verify sequence)
- Is the master file properly structured? (check format)
- Could there be duplicates? (check for conflicts)
- Are there any missing docs? (gap analysis)
- Is the file size reasonable? (verify completeness)

Agent actions:
1. List all doc files
2. Verify master file structure
3. Check for existing parts
4. Identify gaps
5. Add in correct order
6. Verify final result
7. Report what was added + what was missing
```

**When to Apply**:
- ALWAYS - Critical thinking should be default mode
- Especially when:
  - User request seems incomplete
  - Multiple interpretations possible
  - High stakes (production, data, security)
  - Complex multi-step operations

**Critical Thinking Questions**:

Before executing ANY task, ask:
1. **Completeness**: What might be missing?
2. **Assumptions**: What am I assuming that might be wrong?
3. **Edge cases**: What could go wrong?
4. **Verification**: How will I know it worked?
5. **Impact**: What are the consequences of errors?
6. **Alternatives**: Is there a better approach?

**Examples**:

❌ **WRONG** (Uncritical):
```
User: "Deploy to production"
Agent: *deploys immediately*
```

✅ **CORRECT** (MB.MD - Critical):
```
User: "use mb.md: Deploy to production"

Agent critical thinking:
⚠️  CRITICAL ANALYSIS BEFORE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:

1. Tests Status: Have all tests passed?
   - Running test suite... ✅ All 234 tests passing

2. Database Migrations: Any pending migrations?
   - Checking... ⚠️  WARNING: 2 pending migrations found
   - Need to run: npm run db:push

3. Environment Variables: Are all secrets configured?
   - Checking production secrets... ✅ All 12 secrets present

4. Backup: Is database backed up?
   - Last backup: 2 hours ago ✅
   - Triggering fresh backup... ✅ Complete

5. Rollback Plan: Can we rollback if needed?
   - Git commit: abc123 (tagged as pre-deploy-v2.1.0) ✅
   - Database backup: backup_20251030_1200.sql ✅

6. Monitoring: Are alerts configured?
   - Sentry: ✅ Configured
   - Error rate threshold: 5% ✅

7. Traffic: Is this a low-traffic window?
   - Current traffic: 47 users online ⚠️  MEDIUM
   - Recommended: Wait 2 hours for off-peak (< 20 users)

RECOMMENDATION: Run migrations first, wait for off-peak window,
then deploy. Proceed? [y/N]
```

=======================================================================
SECTION 3: MB.MD EXECUTION PATTERNS
=======================================================================

### Pattern 1: Documentation Creation

**User Request**: "use mb.md: document the API"

**MB.MD Execution**:

1. **SIMULTANEOUSLY**: Identify ALL documentation needs in parallel
   - Endpoint reference
   - Authentication guide
   - Rate limiting docs
   - Error codes
   - SDK examples
   - Webhook documentation

2. **RECURSIVELY**: Break each section into atomic detail
   - For each endpoint:
     - HTTP method, path, description
     - Request parameters (type, required, validation)
     - Response format (success, error cases)
     - Example requests (curl, JavaScript, Python)
     - Common errors and solutions

3. **CRITICALLY**: Verify completeness
   - Are all 100+ endpoints documented?
   - Are examples tested and working?
   - Is authentication explained clearly?
   - Are there any undocumented features?
   - Is versioning strategy explained?

---

### Pattern 2: Code Implementation

**User Request**: "use mb.md: implement user authentication"

**MB.MD Execution**:

1. **SIMULTANEOUSLY**: Create all components in parallel
   - Database schema (users table)
   - API routes (register, login, logout, refresh)
   - Frontend forms (login, register)
   - Auth middleware
   - Session management
   - Password hashing utilities

2. **RECURSIVELY**: Implement each layer completely
   - Database: fields, indexes, constraints, migrations
   - API: validation, error handling, rate limiting, logging
   - Frontend: form validation, error display, loading states
   - Security: CSRF protection, XSS prevention, SQL injection

3. **CRITICALLY**: Security review
   - Are passwords hashed with bcrypt (12+ rounds)?
   - Are JWTs signed with strong secret (256-bit)?
   - Is session storage secure (httpOnly cookies)?
   - Are there rate limits on login attempts?
   - Is 2FA support architected?
   - Can system handle concurrent logins?

---

### Pattern 3: Troubleshooting

**User Request**: "use mb.md: app is slow, fix it"

**MB.MD Execution**:

1. **SIMULTANEOUSLY**: Check all potential bottlenecks
   - Database query performance
   - API response times
   - Frontend bundle size
   - Network latency
   - Cache hit rates
   - Server resource usage

2. **RECURSIVELY**: Drill into each issue
   - Database:
     - Identify slow queries (pg_stat_statements)
     - Check for missing indexes
     - Analyze query plans (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
   - API:
     - Profile endpoint response times
     - Check for N+1 queries
     - Review middleware overhead
   - Frontend:
     - Bundle size analysis
     - Component render counts
     - Unnecessary re-renders

3. **CRITICALLY**: Prioritize fixes by impact
   - Which issues affect most users?
   - Quick wins vs. long-term solutions
   - Test fixes don't break functionality
   - Measure improvement before/after

=======================================================================
SECTION 4: WHEN TO USE MB.MD
=======================================================================

### Always Use MB.MD When:

✅ User explicitly says "use mb.md" or "mb.md:"
✅ Creating documentation (must be complete)
✅ Production deployments (must be safe)
✅ Data migrations (must be verified)
✅ Security implementations (must be thorough)
✅ Complex multi-step tasks (must be organized)
✅ Training new agents (must be comprehensive)

### Optional MB.MD (Use Judgment):

⚠️  Simple single-step tasks (e.g., "fix typo in README")
⚠️  Trivial code changes (e.g., "change button color to blue")
⚠️  Quick information lookups (e.g., "what's the Stripe API version?")

### Never Skip MB.MD:

🚫 When user health/safety involved
🚫 When money/payments involved
🚫 When data loss possible
🚫 When security breach possible
🚫 When production system affected

```

=======================================================================
SECTION 6: MB.MD SELF-VERIFICATION
=======================================================================

After completing a task with MB.MD, verify:

### Simultaneously Checklist:
- [ ] Did I execute independent tasks in parallel?
- [ ] Did I batch operations where possible?
- [ ] Did I avoid unnecessary sequential steps?

### Recursively Checklist:
- [ ] Did I explore to atomic detail?
- [ ] Did I document all sub-components?
- [ ] Did I explain "why" not just "what"?
- [ ] Would someone unfamiliar understand completely?

### Critically Checklist:
- [ ] Did I question my assumptions?
- [ ] Did I identify and fill gaps?
- [ ] Did I verify the result?
- [ ] Did I consider edge cases?
- [ ] Did I think about what could go wrong?

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked**: The task was not truly MB.MD.

=======================================================================
SECTION 7: MB.MD ANTI-PATTERNS
=======================================================================

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 1: Fake Parallelism

**Wrong**:
```
User: "use mb.md: create 3 files"
Agent: "Creating file 1... done. Creating file 2... done. Creating file 3... done."
```

**Right**:
```
User: "use mb.md: create 3 files"
Agent: [Calls write tool 3 times in parallel function_calls block]
"✅ Created all 3 files simultaneously!"
```

---

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 2: Shallow Recursion

**Wrong**:
```
User: "use mb.md: document authentication"
Agent: "Authentication uses JWT tokens. Users log in with email/password."
```

**Right**:
```
User: "use mb.md: document authentication"
Agent: [Creates comprehensive doc with]:
- Token structure (header, payload, signature)
- Secret management (rotation, storage)
- Flow diagrams (registration, login, refresh)
- Security measures (rate limiting, brute force protection)
- Error handling (invalid token, expired token, etc.)
- Code examples (3 languages)
- Testing guide
```

---

### ❌ ANTI-PATTERN 3: Uncritical Acceptance

**Wrong**:
```
User: "use mb.md: deploy to production"
Agent: [Deploys immediately without checks]
```

**Right**:
```
User: "use mb.md: deploy to production"
Agent:
"⚠️  CRITICAL PRE-DEPLOYMENT CHECKS:
1. Tests: Running... ✅ 234 passing
2. Migrations: ⚠️  2 pending - need to run first
3. Secrets: ✅ All configured
4. Backup: Creating fresh backup...
5. Traffic: 47 users online (medium)

RECOMMENDATION: Run migrations, wait for off-peak window.
Proceed? [y/N]"
