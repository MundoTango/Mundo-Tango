# Mission: Refresh Facebook Page Access Token and Complete Mundo Tango Facebook Invite System
## CONTEXT
We're building Mundo Tango, a global tango community platform. We need to:
1. Refresh an expired Facebook Page Access Token
2. Update the token in Replit secrets
3. Complete testing of our Facebook Messenger invite system
4. Send test invite to sboddye@gmail.com via Facebook Messenger
5. Run automated Playwright tests to verify end-to-end journey
## TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
- **Project:** Replit project "MundoTango" at https://replit.com/@admin3304/MundoTango
- **Current Status:** Facebook Page Access Token expired November 12, 2025
- **Infrastructure Built:** 
  - ✅ Token validation system
  - ✅ Facebook Messenger integration
  - ✅ AI invite generator (GPT-4o powered)
  - ✅ Recursive monitoring (7 social platforms)
  - ✅ Playwright E2E test suite
- **Blocking Issue:** Need fresh Facebook Page Access Token to proceed
## YOUR TASKS
### TASK 1: Generate New Facebook Page Access Token (5 min)
**Steps:**
1. Open browser and navigate to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps
2. Log in to Facebook if needed (credentials: Use Scott's Facebook account)
3. Find and select the "Mundo Tango" app (or create if doesn't exist)
4. Navigate to: **Messenger → Settings** (in left sidebar)
5. Scroll to **Access Tokens** section
6. Find your Mundo Tango Facebook Page
7. Click **"Generate Token"** button next to the page
8. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the generated token immediately (it won't show again)
9. The token should start with something like `EAAG...` or `EAA...`
**Expected Result:** You should have a long string token (100+ characters) copied to clipboard
---
### TASK 2: Update Replit Secrets (2 min)
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to: https://replit.com/@admin3304/MundoTango
2. Click **"Tools"** in left sidebar
3. Click **"Secrets"** (lock icon)
4. Find the secret key: `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
5. If it exists: Click edit, paste new token, save
6. If it doesn't exist: Click **"New Secret"**, name it `FACEBOOK_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, paste token, save
7. **Verify:** The secret should now show in the list with a masked value
**Expected Result:** Secret successfully updated in Replit
---
### TASK 3: Verify Token with Replit AI (3 min)
**Steps:**
1. In Replit, click **"AI"** button (top right)
2. Paste this message to Replit AI:

Test the Facebook token by running this command:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/facebook-messenger/validate-token

If it returns "isValid": true, proceed to generate invite message:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/facebook/test-and-generate-invite

Show me the results of both commands.

3. Wait for Replit AI to execute the commands
4. **Verify:** First command should show `"isValid": true` and token details
5. **Verify:** Second command should show generated invite message for sboddye@gmail.com
**Expected Result:** Token validated + Invite message generated successfully
---
### TASK 4: Converse with Replit AI to Complete Work (10 min)
**Message to Replit AI:**

The Facebook token is now valid. Please complete the following tasks using MB.MD v8.2 methodology:

PHASE 4: Add Tester Role

Guide me through adding sboddye@gmail.com as a Tester in Facebook App Dashboard
This allows us to send messages without 24-hour window restriction
Show me the exact steps
PHASE 5: Send Test Invite

Review the generated invite message
Send the invite to sboddye@gmail.com Facebook Messenger
Monitor for successful delivery
Log the messageId
PHASE 6: Run Playwright E2E Verification

Execute the test: server/tests/e2e/facebook-invite-journey.test.ts
This will verify:
Invite received in sboddye's Facebook Messenger
Link works and redirects to Mundo Tango platform
Login with scott@boddye.com works
Progress bar appears showing mb.md learnings
Provide screenshots from /tmp/screenshots/
Report progress at each phase with % updates.

4. Follow any additional instructions from Replit AI
5. Provide Facebook credentials if needed for testing
6. Approve the invite message when shown
**Expected Result:** Complete end-to-end system working, invite sent, tests passing
---
## IMPORTANT NOTES
### Facebook App Setup (If Needed)
If Mundo Tango app doesn't exist in Facebook Developers:
1. Create new app → **Business** type
2. Add **Messenger** product
3. Generate Page Access Token for your page
4. Add test user: sboddye@gmail.com as **Tester** role
### Security & Privacy
- ✅ All actions are lawful and authorized by Scott (project owner)
- ✅ Facebook tokens are for legitimate business use (Mundo Tango platform)
- ✅ No personal data collection beyond what's needed
- ✅ Complies with Vercept privacy policy (local processing, user-authorized)
- ✅ Complies with Facebook Developer policies (proper token management)
### Credentials Needed
- **Facebook:** Scott's Facebook account (for Developers Console)
- **Replit:** Already logged in at https://replit.com/@admin3304/MundoTango
- **Facebook Test Account:** sboddye@gmail.com (for receiving test invite)
### Troubleshooting
- **Token still invalid:** Ensure you copied the entire token (no spaces/truncation)
- **Can't find Mundo Tango app:** Create new app, add Messenger product
- **Replit AI not responding:** Refresh page, try again
- **Playwright test fails:** Check if sboddye@gmail.com password is set in environment

**You can interact with Replit AI in natural language - it understands context and can execute commands, run tests, and complete complex tasks autonomously.**

I'll help you complete this Facebook Page Access Token refresh and Mundo Tango Facebook invite system task. Let me start by creating a TODO.md file to track our progress through this complex workflow.

Sorry some further clarification "# Mission: Facebook Token Refresh + Mundo Tango Invite System Completion
**Execution Protocol:** MB.MD-VY v1.0 (Simultaneously, Recursively, Critically)
---
## 🌍 THE MISSION (Why This Matters)
**Mundo Tango** is Scott's mission to reverse the negative impacts of social media silos and change the world by connecting authentic communities globally. You're enabling the FIRST invitation to be sent, marking the beginning of this world-changing journey.
**18 hours/day since September 2025**, Scott has been building this platform. This Facebook integration is critical to the mission. Every step you take brings Mundo Tango closer to changing how communities connect worldwide.
---
## 📋 CORE METHODOLOGY: SIMULTANEOUSLY, RECURSIVELY, CRITICALLY
### HOW TO WORK
**SIMULTANEOUSLY:**
- Execute multiple tasks in parallel (while Facebook loads, prepare next step)
- Don't wait unnecessarily - keep moving
**RECURSIVELY:**
- Go DEEP, not surface-level
- If something fails, understand WHY (don't just report errors)
- Fix issues yourself before reporting
**CRITICALLY:**
- Verify EVERY step before proceeding (95-99/100 quality standard)
- Check, double-check, triple-check critical operations
- Never skip verification checkpoints
---
## 🎯 YOUR TASKS + VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS

**✅ CHECKPOINT 1 - Token Generation:**
- [ ] Token copied to clipboard (count: 180+ characters)
- [ ] Token starts with `EAA` or `EAAG`
- [ ] No spaces or line breaks
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Paste into text editor, count characters, inspect visually

🔧 SELF-HEALING PROTOCOLS - How to auto-fix common issues at 3 error levels
📊 PROGRESS REPORTING - Update Scott every 5 minutes with % complete
📖 JOURNEY RECORDING - Log everything for Scott's book
🔒 SAFETY RULES - What Vy can/can't do autonomously

🚨 Blocked: Replit workspace taking unusually long to load

The Replit workspace is taking longer than expected to load. This is a Level 2 error (Retry 3x). Let me try a different approach - I'll try accessing the workspace through a direct URL or wait longer as Replit can sometimes be slow.
