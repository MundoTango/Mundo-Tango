# MISSION: BUILD MUNDO TANGO PLATFORM (0-50% IMPLEMENTATION)
## Context
You are building the **Mundo Tango platform** (mundotango.life) - a comprehensive Life CEO & Multi-Community tango platform. You have a **complete 75,032-line handoff document** (`docs/handoff/ULTIMATE_ZERO_TO_DEPLOY_COMPLETE.md`) that contains 100% production-ready code, zero placeholders, and complete implementations for the first 50% of the platform.
**IMPORTANT:** Some platform features have already been partially built using early versions of this documentation. Your job is to:
1. Analyze what exists
2. Read the complete handoff document
3. Build a comprehensive MB.MD plan
4. Implement everything to match the document exactly
## Your First Steps (CRITICAL - DO THESE IN ORDER)
### Step 1: Analyze Current State
```bash
# Check project structure
ls -la
# Check what files exist
find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -30
# Check database schema
cat shared/schema.ts 2>/dev/null || echo "Schema file doesn't exist yet"
# Check package.json
cat package.json
# Check what's already implemented
grep -r "export function\|export class\|export const" server/ client/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l

Step 2: Read the Complete Documentation
# Check document size
wc -l docs/handoff/ULTIMATE_ZERO_TO_DEPLOY_COMPLETE.md
# View table of contents
grep "^# PART" docs/handoff/ULTIMATE_ZERO_TO_DEPLOY_COMPLETE.md
# Read key sections
# (You MUST read the entire 75K-line document to understand what to build)

Step 3: Create MB.MD Implementation Plan
Using the MB.MD methodology (Simultaneously, Recursively, Critically), create a task list that:

Analyzes gaps between current implementation and the documentation
Identifies all features documented in Parts 1-135 (0-50% of platform)
Prioritizes implementation based on dependencies
Plans parallel execution (build multiple features simultaneously)
Ensures zero placeholders (every feature fully implemented)
Reference: See docs/handoff/COMPREHENSIVE_AI_COMPLETE_HANDOFF.md Section 17 for complete MB.MD methodology guide.

What the Documentation Contains (0-50%)
The 75,032-line document includes complete, production-ready implementations of:

Core Infrastructure (Parts 1-15)
Complete database schema (PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)
Full backend API (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
Complete frontend (React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui)
Authentication system (JWT, sessions, RBAC, 2FA)
Real-time features (Socket.IO)
Features to Build (Parts 16-135)
✅ Events System: Full CRUD, RSVP, calendar, reminders
✅ E-commerce: Products, cart, checkout, Stripe integration
✅ Social Features: Posts, comments, likes, follows, messaging
✅ File Management: Cloudinary uploads, image optimization, video processing
✅ Email System: Resend integration, React Email templates
✅ AI Integration: OpenAI, Claude, Groq implementations
✅ Testing Suite: Playwright E2E, Vitest unit, k6 load tests
✅ Monitoring: Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana, PostHog
✅ CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipelines
✅ Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx configurations
MB.MD Methodology Requirements
When implementing, you MUST:

M - Multiple (Simultaneous Execution)
Build multiple features at once
Don't do one file at a time
Implement frontend + backend + database for each feature simultaneously
Example: When building Events, create schema + API routes + React components all together
B - Best Practices (Production Quality)
Zero placeholders or TODOs
Complete error handling
Full input validation
Proper TypeScript types
Security hardening (authentication, authorization, rate limiting)
Performance optimization (caching, indexing, lazy loading)
M - Massive (Scale)
Think in terms of complete features, not individual functions
Implement entire subsystems at once
Add comprehensive tests for everything
Build for scale (10K+ concurrent users)
D - Deployment Ready (Production Code)
Every line must be deployable
No mock data in production paths
Complete database migrations
Proper environment variable handling
Full monitoring and logging
Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
✅ Match the documentation exactly - Build what's in the 75K-line doc
✅ Zero placeholders - No "TODO" or "implement this later"
✅ Production-ready - Code that can deploy today
✅ Fully tested - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
✅ Properly typed - Complete TypeScript coverage
✅ Security hardened - Input validation, authentication, authorization
✅ Performance optimized - Caching, indexes, lazy loading

Platform Information
Domain: mundotango.life (use this in all configurations)
API: api.mundotango.life
Support: support@mundotango.life
Docs: docs.mundotango.life
Tech Stack: Node.js 20+, React 18+, TypeScript 5+, PostgreSQL 16+, Redis 7+
Your Implementation Workflow
1. Analysis Phase (First)
# Read documentation structure
grep "^# PART" docs/handoff/ULTIMATE_ZERO_TO_DEPLOY_COMPLETE.md
# Understand what exists
ls -R server/ client/ shared/
# Check database current state
npm run db:push -- --dry-run

2. Planning Phase (Second)
Create a comprehensive task list:

 Database schema completion (match Parts 1-10)
 Authentication system (Parts 11-15)
 Events system (Parts 16-30)
 E-commerce system (Parts 31-50)
 Social features (Parts 51-70)
 Real-time messaging (Parts 71-85)
 File management (Parts 86-95)
 Testing suite (Parts 96-115)
 Monitoring & DevOps (Parts 116-135)
3. Execution Phase (Third)
Build using MB.MD methodology:

Implement features in parallel
Complete entire subsystems at once
Add tests as you build
Deploy and validate continuously
4. Validation Phase (Fourth)
# Run all tests
npm run test:all
# Check TypeScript
npm run type-check
# Test API endpoints
npm run test:integration
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
# Check security
npm audit
# Verify database schema
npm run db:push -- --dry-run

Example: How to Approach Events System
Instead of building one file at a time, use MB.MD:

Read the Events documentation (Parts 16-30 in the handoff doc)
Implement simultaneously:
Database schema: shared/schema.ts (events, rsvps, eventCategories tables)
Backend API: server/routes.ts (all events endpoints)
Storage layer: server/storage.ts (IStorage interface methods)
Frontend components: client/src/pages/Events.tsx, client/src/components/EventCard.tsx
Forms: client/src/components/forms/EventForm.tsx
Tests: tests/integration/events.test.ts, tests/e2e/events.spec.ts
Deploy and validate that everything works together
Critical Files to Reference
Before building, read these key files in the documentation:

Database schema examples (Parts 1-5)
API route patterns (Parts 6-10)
Frontend component structure (Parts 11-20)
Testing examples (Parts 96-115)
Deployment configurations (Parts 116-135)
Questions to Answer Before Building
What database tables are documented but not yet created?
What API endpoints are documented but not yet implemented?
What React components are documented but not yet built?
What tests are documented but not yet written?
What integrations (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.) are documented but not yet configured?
Success Criteria
✅ All features from Parts 1-135 implemented
✅ All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
✅ Zero TypeScript errors
✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
✅ Application runs locally without errors
✅ All documented API endpoints working
✅ All documented React components rendering
✅ Database schema matches documentation exactly
✅ Real-time features (Socket.IO) working
✅ Payment processing (Stripe) functional
✅ File uploads (Cloudinary) working
✅ Email system (Resend) sending
✅ Monitoring (Sentry) configured
✅ CI/CD pipeline passing

Your First Task
Create a comprehensive MB.MD task list that:

Lists every feature documented in Parts 1-135
Identifies what's already built vs. what's missing
Groups features into parallel workstreams
Estimates complexity and dependencies
Plans the build sequence
Then show me the task list for approval before starting implementation.

Remember
Read FIRST - Understand the entire 75K-line document
Plan SECOND - Create comprehensive MB.MD task list
Build THIRD - Implement everything simultaneously
Validate LAST - Test and deploy
The documentation contains EVERYTHING you need. Your job is to BUILD it exactly as documented.
