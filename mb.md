## 🎯 THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**

### **YOU ARE NOT BUILDING MUNDO TANGO DIRECTLY.**

### **YOU ARE BUILDING MR BLUE AI PARTNER WHO WILL THEN BUILD MUNDO TANGO.**

```
WEEK 1-8:  Build Mr Blue (8 systems: Context, Video, Avatars, Vibe Coding, Voice, Screen, Docs, Self-Improve)
    ↓
WEEK 9-12: Mr Blue builds 927 features (via vibe coding engine)
    ↓
WEEK 13-16: Scott's 47-page validation tour (Mr Blue auto-fixes 90%+ bugs)
    ↓
WEEK 17-20: Production readiness & launch (Facebook scraping, compliance, deploy)
```

**Why this approach?**
- Mr Blue has 8 specialized systems (video calls, vibe coding, dual avatars, voice cloning)
- Mr Blue codes faster than manual implementation (natural language → production code)
- Mr Blue learns from Scott through 10 learning pathways
- Mr Blue achieves 80% bug auto-detection by Week 8
- Progressive autonomy: Scott's involvement 100% → 0% over 20 weeks

**Mr Blue is NOT a feature. Mr Blue is the AI development partner that builds the platform.**

**Current Status:** 🎉 **ALL 8 MR BLUE SYSTEMS DEPLOYED - WEEK 1-8 COMPLETE!**

---

## 🚀 THE FOUR PILLARS (MB.MD v6.0)

### **PILLAR 1: SIMULTANEOUSLY**
Never work sequentially when parallel is possible.

**Execute with 3-9 parallel subagents:**
```
0-60min: Main agent + 3-9 subagents all work ✅
60-90min: Validation & testing (all parallel) ✅
```

**Example Wave Timeline:**
- Subagent 1: Build dashboard UI (20min)
- Subagent 2: Build API routes (20min)
- Subagent 3: Write tests (20min)
- Subagent 4: Update schema (20min)
- Main agent: Coordinates + works in parallel (20min)

**Result:** 75min per wave vs 165min baseline = **45% faster**

---

### **PILLAR 2: RECURSIVELY**
Drill down into every component until reaching atomic level.

**Stopping Conditions:**
- Primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Well-documented external libraries
- Previously documented components
- Atomic operations that cannot be subdivided

**Never stop at surface level.** Explore dependencies, implications, foundations.

---

### **PILLAR 3: CRITICALLY**
Question everything, verify thoroughly, ensure production-ready quality.

**10-Layer Quality Pipeline:**
1. Pre-Flight Checks (search existing code first)
2. LSP Validation (TypeScript type checking)
3. Schema Validation (database safety)
4. Playwright E2E (real user workflows)
5. Regression Tests (existing features still work)
6. Code Review (12-point checklist)
7. Runtime Validation (no console errors)
8. Error Catalog (document bugs found)
9. Template Validation (only promote battle-tested code)
10. Continuous Monitoring (post-deployment)

**Target:** <0.3 bugs per feature (75% reduction from baseline)

---

### **PILLAR 4: CONTINUOUS LEARNING + COLLABORATION** (NEW v6.0)

**At Every Moment, Ask Yourself:**

#### **1. What Can I Learn From The Work I Just Did?**

After every task completion:
```markdown
✅ Task Complete: Tier enforcement middleware

LEARNING CAPTURE:
- What worked well: requireTier() middleware pattern is reusable
- What was difficult: Nested subscription queries slowed down
- What would I do differently: Cache subscription tiers in Redis
- Pattern extracted: Middleware authentication pattern
- Time saved vs baseline: 15min (used template)
- Bugs found: 0 (LSP validation caught type errors early)

→ ACTION: Save pattern for future use
```

**Learning Categories:**
- Technical: Code patterns, architecture decisions, performance
- Process: What workflow steps were efficient/wasteful
- Errors: What bugs occurred, how to prevent in future
- Time: Actual vs estimated, what caused delays
- Cost: Actual cost vs budget, optimization opportunities

---

#### **2. What Will I Share To Which Agent?**

**SHARE UP (to CEO Agent #0 / Scott):**
- Strategic insights (architecture changes, major risks)
- Budget implications (cost overruns, savings)
- Timeline impacts (delays, acceleration)
- Go/No-Go decisions requiring approval

**SHARE ACROSS (to peer agents):**
- Reusable patterns (code templates, solutions)
- Best practices discovered
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Collaboration requests (blockers, dependencies)

**SHARE DOWN (to specialist agents):**
- Implementation details
- Code examples
- Specific tasks with context
- Testing requirements

---

#### **3. What Has Gone Wrong?**

**Failure Analysis Loop:**

After every issue, incident, or bug:
```markdown
INCIDENT: Workflow restart failed (exit 135)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- What happened: Out of memory during npm install
- Why it happened: Too many dependencies loaded simultaneously
- Impact: 30min delay, workflow down
- Pattern: This is 3rd time this month

PREVENTION:
- Immediate fix: Restart with --max-old-space-size=4096
- Long-term fix: Implement dependency caching layer
- Process update: Add memory monitoring to pre-flight checks

LEARNING EXTRACTION:
- Anti-pattern identified: Installing 50+ packages at once
- Better approach: Batch installations in groups of 10
```

---

#### **4. What Do I Need Cross or Up Assistance On?**

**Request Assistance When:**

**CROSS-AGENT (Peer Collaboration):**
- Blocked on dependency from another agent's work
- Need expertise in area outside your specialty
- Stuck on problem for >30 minutes
- Need code review from fresh perspective

**UP-AGENT (Escalation):**
- Strategic decision needed (architecture change)
- Budget exceeded or timeline at risk
- Security/legal issue discovered
- Production incident requiring leadership

---

---

## 🚨 47 P0 BLOCKERS (CRITICAL)

**Total P0 Effort:** ~200 hours (4-5 weeks with Mr Blue)

**Top 10 P0 Blockers:**

1. **Tier Enforcement Middleware** - Everyone has God Level for free ($0 revenue)
2. **Database RLS** - User A can see User B's data (GDPR violation)
3. **CSRF Protection** - Vulnerable to cross-site attacks
4. **Revenue Sharing** - Platform can't monetize (Stripe Connect)
5. **GDPR Data Export/Deletion** - Legal requirement
6. **2FA** - Two-Factor Authentication
7. **Legal Acceptance** - Terms, Privacy policy acceptance
8. **Subscription Cancellation** - Users can't cancel
9. **Rate Limiting** - Vulnerable to abuse
10. **Audit Logging** - No security trail

**Status:** 47/47 complete (100%) according to replit.md Wave 11

---

## 🎓 CODE PATTERNS & TEMPLATES (70% Time Savings)

### **Template Library:**

1. **Dashboard Pattern** (60min → 15min)
2. **CRUD API Pattern** (40min → 10min)
3. **Form Pattern** (25min → 7min)
4. **Authentication Pattern** (30min → 8min)
5. **Tier Enforcement Pattern** (20min → 5min)

### **Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do):**

**Anti-Pattern #1: Loading Full Context**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD
const context = await loadAllDocumentation(); // 111K tokens

// ✅ GOOD
const context = await contextService.selectiveLoad(query); // 600 tokens
```

**Anti-Pattern #2: No Error Handling**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD
const user = await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, id));

// ✅ GOOD
try {
  const [user] = await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, id));
  if (!user) throw new Error('User not found');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Database error:', error);
  return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Database error' });
}
```

**ALWAYS use these environment secrets for ALL Playwright tests:**
- Email: `process.env.TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL` 
- Password: `process.env.TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- Role: `god` (God Level - full platform access)

**Mandatory Pattern:**
```typescript
const email = process.env.TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL!;
const password = process.env.TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD!;

await page.goto('/login');
await page.fill('[data-testid="input-email"]', email);
await page.fill('[data-testid="input-password"]', password);
await page.click('[data-testid="button-login"]');
await page.waitForURL(/\/(?!login)/);

### 🎓 **Mr Blue API Integration Guidelines**

**When building autonomously (Weeks 9-12), follow these rules:**

1. **Check Rate Limits**: Always review API documentation for free tier limits
2. **Cache Aggressively**: Store responses to minimize API calls (use Redis)
3. **Server-Side First**: Make API calls from backend, not browser (security + CORS)
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if API fails (show cached/default data)
5. **API Key Management**: Store in Replit Secrets, never hardcode
6. **CORS Check**: Verify CORS support before browser-side integration
7. **Authentication**: Prefer OAuth over API keys when available
8. **Cost Monitoring**: Track usage, warn user before paid tier threshold
9. **Compliance**: Review ToS for commercial use, attribution requirements
10. **Testing**: E2E tests must mock API responses (don't spam real APIs)

### 💡 **Vibe Coding API Commands**

## 🎓 FINAL EXECUTION SUMMARY

**The Strategy:**
1. Build Mr Blue AI Partner (Weeks 1-8) ← **YOU ARE HERE**
2. Mr Blue builds 927 features (Weeks 9-12)
3. Test with Scott (Weeks 13-16)
4. Launch (Weeks 17-20)

**The Methodology:**
- Work SIMULTANEOUSLY (parallel subagents, never sequential)
- Think RECURSIVELY (drill to atomic level, never surface-level)
- Validate CRITICALLY (10-layer quality pipeline, 95%+ target)
- Learn CONTINUOUSLY (capture insights, share knowledge, analyze failures, request assistance)

**The Result:**
- 45% faster execution
- 40% lower costs
- 75% fewer bugs
- Progressive autonomy (Scott 100% → 0%)
