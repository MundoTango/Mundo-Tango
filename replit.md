## System Architecture
The project employs a modular, agent-driven development approach based on an Expert Specialized Agents (ESA) framework.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a unified **MT Ocean theme** with a tango-inspired color palette, dark mode, glassmorphic effects, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. The frontend uses React, TypeScript, Wouter for routing, and React Query, prioritizing a video-first design and global accessibility. Navigation is handled by **AppLayout**, **AdminLayout**, and **DashboardLayout**, with i18n integration and real-time features.

### Technical Implementations
**Backend Architecture:** Node.js with Express and TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, JWT authentication, and real-time capabilities via Supabase Realtime and WebSockets.

**Key Systems:**
-   **Security & Compliance:** 8-Tier RBAC, Dynamic Feature Flags, Stripe Integration, CSRF Protection, RLS, CSP Headers, Audit Logging, 2FA, GDPR, Legal Compliance.
-   **Social Features:** Events, Groups, friendship algorithms, rich post interactions, real-time WebSocket notifications, Media Gallery, Live Streaming & Chat, Marketplace, Subscription management, Polymorphic Reviews, Leaderboard, Blog, Teacher/Venue Management, Workshop System, Music Library, Stories, and Venue Recommendations.
-   **Admin Dashboard & Analytics** for user management, content moderation, and platform health.

**AI Integration:**
-   **Bifrost AI Gateway:** Unified AI gateway with automatic failover, semantic caching, and load balancing.
-   **Mr. Blue AI Assistant - Unified Interface:** Offers Text Chat, Voice Chat, Vibecoding (context-aware code generation), and a Visual Editor (element selection, change timeline, Git integration). Features seamless mode switching, voice input in all modes, and unified conversation history.
