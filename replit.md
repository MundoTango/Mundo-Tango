# Mundo Tango

## Overview
Mundo Tango is a production-ready social platform designed to connect the global tango community. It offers comprehensive social networking features, event management, talent matching, and advanced AI-powered assistance. The platform integrates 7 business systems and 62 specialized AI agents, aiming to become the leading digital hub for the tango ecosystem. Its business model targets premium services, event monetization, and targeted advertising, built on a self-sovereign, resilient architecture with minimal third-party dependencies, optimized npm packages, and enterprise-grade security.

## User Preferences
**Methodology:** MB.MD Protocol v9.2 (see mb.md for complete methodology with Free Energy Principle + Organoid Intelligence)
- Work simultaneously (parallel execution with 3 subagents)
- Work recursively (deep exploration, not surface-level)
- Work critically (rigorous quality, 95-99/100 target)
- **NEW v8.0**: AI Agent Learning (DPO, Curriculum, GEPA, LIMI)
- **NEW v8.0**: 5 Development-First Principles (Security, Error, Performance, Mobile, Accessibility)
- **NEW v9.0**: **Agent SME Training System** - Agents become Subject Matter Experts by learning ALL documentation, code, and industry standards BEFORE implementation

**Never deviate from the handoff plan** - Follow the exact phase sequence

## System Architecture
The project utilizes a modular, agent-driven development approach based on an Expert Specialized Agents (ESA) framework, emphasizing a self-sovereign architecture.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a unified **MT Ocean theme** with a tango-inspired color palette, dark mode, glassmorphic effects, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Wouter for routing, and React Query, prioritizing a video-first design and global accessibility. Navigation is managed by **AppLayout**, **AdminLayout**, and **DashboardLayout**, including i18n integration and real-time features.

### Technical Implementations
**Backend Architecture:** Node.js with Express and TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, JWT authentication, and real-time capabilities via Supabase Realtime and WebSockets.

**Authentication & Access Patterns (MB.MD Protocol v9.2):**
-   **Visual Editor Public Access:** Visual Editor routes (`/`, `/mrblue/visual-editor`, `/admin/visual-editor`) are PUBLIC and accessible without authentication. Implements auth-optional UX where users can view/explore Visual Editor without login, with degraded functionality (view-only) for unauthenticated users.
-   **401 Error Handling:** Global query error handler (`client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`) intelligently handles 401 Unauthorized errors by:
    -   Bypassing login redirect for public paths (Visual Editor, login, register)
    -   Gracefully degrading UX for unauthenticated access
    -   Only redirecting to `/login` for protected routes requiring authentication
-   **MB.MD Protocol v9.2 Integration:** Implements Free Energy Principle (Expected Free Energy calculation), Active Inference (proactive error detection), and Bayesian Belief Updating (user preference modeling) for optimal auth UX.
-   **Design Philosophy:** Follows "auth-optional" pattern where public features are accessible without forced authentication, reducing friction while maintaining security for protected features. Similar UX pattern as Mr. Blue Chat (public access with degraded features).

Supports seamless mode switching, voice input in all modes, and unified conversation history.
        -   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING: Vibecoding Intent Classification (Phase 1)** - Server logs confirm `[Orchestrator] 🎯 UI MODIFICATION intent detected: "make the"` for requests like "Can you make the Watch demo button blue?" Tier 0 priority detection working at 0ms latency.
        -   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING: Natural Language UI Modification Detection (Phase 2)** - 18+ UI modification patterns ("make the", "change the", "color to", "add a button", etc.) successfully trigger action intent at 99% confidence. Logs show: `[Mr. Blue] Intent classified as: action (confidence: 0.99)`.
        -   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING: Context Awareness (Phase 3)** - Page context injection working. Logs show: `[Mr. Blue] ❓ Handling as QUESTION with page context`.
        -   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING: Code Generation (Phase 4)** - VibeCodingService successfully generates code. Logs show: `[CodeGenerator] ✅ Generated 1 file changes` and `[VibeCoding] 🎉 Code generation complete`.
        -   **✅ FIXED: Chat Memory Database (Phase 5)** - Added mrBlueConversations and mrBlueMessages to server/storage.ts schema initialization. Running `npm run db:push --force` to sync database.
