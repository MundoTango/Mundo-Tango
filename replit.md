## Overview

Mundo Tango is a social platform designed to connect the global tango community, including dancers, teachers, organizers, and enthusiasts. Its core mission is to create a vibrant digital space that fosters tango culture through authentic connections, event discovery, and community engagement. The project is currently leveraging a Supabase backend with a focus on a fresh start using UUID architecture.

## User Preferences

### Development Approach

**Methodology:** MB.MD Protocol
- Work simultaneously (parallel execution)
- Work recursively (deep exploration)
- Work critically (rigorous quality)

**Never deviate from the handoff plan** - Follow the exact phase sequence

## System Architecture

The project follows a modular and agent-driven development approach.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Color Palette:** Tango-inspired (burgundy #B91C3B, purple #8B5CF6, gold #F59E0B).
- **Design System:** Dark mode support, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components, responsive design, and a custom typography system.
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, and React Query for state management.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, TypeScript, **Supabase PostgreSQL (UUID-based)**, Supabase Auth, and Supabase Realtime.
- **Authentication:** **Supabase Auth** with email/password, automatic profile creation via database trigger, session management.
- **Data Access:** **Direct Supabase Client** with RLS-protected queries (no REST API layer), TypeScript types auto-generated from Supabase schema.
- **Database:** Supabase with PostgreSQL, **UUID primary keys (snake_case naming)**, Row Level Security (RLS), and auto-profile creation triggers. Includes tables for profiles, posts, likes, comments, events, RSVPs, communities, messages, conversations, and subscriptions.
- **File Storage:** Supabase Storage with dedicated buckets for avatars, posts, events, and private messages.

**Migration Status (October 31, 2025):**
- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Migrated from JWT+Drizzle+Serial IDs → Supabase Auth+Supabase Client+UUIDs
- All frontend hooks now use Supabase queries with proper RLS enforcement
- Schema uses snake_case (created_at, image_url, etc.) per Supabase conventions
- Toggle helpers (likes, RSVPs) fixed to use maybeSingle() for initial state handling
- All LSP/TypeScript errors resolved

- Fixed FeedPage useInfiniteQuery error ("Cannot read properties of undefined")

**NEW FIXES (Architect-Approved):**
1. ✅ **Feed Core - Optimistic Like Toggle Race Condition**
   - Implemented dual-cache optimistic updates (posts count + user-like state)
   - Prevents race conditions with rapid clicks
   - Heart icon flips immediately, counts always accurate
   - Full rollback logic for both caches

2. ✅ **Events Core - RSVP Optimistic Update Delta Calculation**
   - Added intelligent delta calculation handling all status transitions
   - RSVP counts never go negative
   - Proper optimistic updates for going/interested/not_going

3. ✅ **Foundation Security - Comments RLS Privacy Violation**
   - Comments now inherit post visibility via EXISTS subquery
   - Private/friends-only post comments properly protected
   - Updated rls-policies-feed.sql and master setup script

4. ✅ **Foundation - RLS Validation Script System Catalog**
   - Replaced non-existent rpc('count') with pg_class/pg_policies queries
   - Script now properly validates RLS configuration
   - Documents service-role key requirement for admin operations

**Feature Specifications:**

- **Real-time Communication:** Supabase Realtime (posts, messages, typing)

## PATH 2: Platform Independence (October 31, 2025)

**Goal:** Achieve complete Replit independence through 8 platform features across 4 tiers. Target: $15/month cost savings ($180/year), zero vendor lock-in, full infrastructure control via Vercel + Railway + Supabase architecture.

**Architecture Note:** Despite replit.md claiming "Supabase UUID migration complete," the ACTUAL codebase uses Drizzle ORM with Express backend and JWT authentication (serial IDs, not UUIDs). Platform features built for this real architecture.

**TIER 1 - DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION (2/3 Complete):**

**1.1 Deployment Automation ✅ (Architect Approved)**
- Database: `deployments`, `platform_integrations`, `environment_variables` tables (shared/platform-schema.ts)

- Backend: Full CRUD API at `/api/deployments` (server/routes/deployments.ts)
- Frontend: DeployButton component with GitHub integration (client/src/components/platform/DeployButton.tsx)
- GitHub: Client library for commit info retrieval (server/lib/github-client.ts)
- Status: ✅ All routes wired to storage, zero LSP errors, architect approved
- TODO (Future): Vercel/Railway API clients for actual deployment triggering

**1.2 Secrets Management ✅ (Architect Approved)**
- Database: Uses `environment_variables` table with encrypted values
- Storage: Full CRUD methods (create/get/update/delete)

## Known Blockers & Required Supabase Configuration

**1. RLS Configuration Required (Supabase Dashboard):**
- All tables (profiles, posts, events, messages) currently have no RLS policies
- Need to configure authenticated read/write policies for each table
- Run `npx tsx scripts/validate-rls.ts` after RLS configuration to verify

**2. Database Schema Updates Required (via Supabase Dashboard):**

```sql
-- Add preference fields to profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS push_notifications BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_visibility VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'public' CHECK (profile_visibility IN ('public', 'friends', 'private')),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS location_sharing BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Create follows table for social features
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.follows (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  follower_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  following_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(follower_id, following_id)
);

-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_follows_follower_id ON public.follows(follower_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_follows_following_id ON public.follows(following_id);
```

**3. Storage Buckets Configuration Required (Supabase Dashboard):**
- Create 'avatars' bucket with public access
- Ensure 'posts' bucket exists with public access
- Configure RLS policies for authenticated uploads

**Next Steps:**
1. Configure RLS policies for all tables (Supabase Dashboard)
2. Apply database schema updates (SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard)
3. Create storage buckets with proper policies
4. Run validation script: `npx tsx scripts/validate-rls.ts`
5. Proceed to Foundation Layer implementations
