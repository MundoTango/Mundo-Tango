## User Preferences

### Development Approach

**Methodology:** MB.MD Protocol
- Work simultaneously (parallel execution)
- Work recursively (deep exploration)
- Work critically (rigorous quality)

**Never deviate from the handoff plan** - Follow the exact phase sequence

## System Architecture

The project follows a modular and agent-driven development approach, leveraging an Expert Specialized Agents (ESA) framework.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Color Palette:** Tango-inspired (burgundy #B91C3B, purple #8B5CF6, gold #F59E0B).
- **Design System:** Dark mode support, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components, responsive design, and a custom typography system.
- **Frontend Framework:** React with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, and React Query for state management.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express, TypeScript.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and serial IDs.
- **Data Access:** Direct client interaction with the database.
- **Real-time Capabilities:** Supabase Realtime for posts, comments, messages, and typing indicators (planned integration).
- **Core Platform Features:** Supabase Auth integration, query helpers, frontend foundation, and design system.
- **Quality Infrastructure:** Error boundaries, centralized logging, performance monitoring, and SEO metadata.
- **Social Features:** Pagination, optimistic updates, full CRUD operations, and follow/unfollow functionality.
- **Platform Independence (Phase 6 - NEW):**
  - Secrets Management: AES-256 encrypted environment variables with sync to Vercel/Railway
  - Git Integration: Repository monitoring, branch tracking, commit history
  - Deployment Automation: CI/CD pipelines, auto-deploy on push, build tracking
  - Monitoring: Real-time uptime, response times, incident tracking
  - Analytics: Deployment stats, API usage, error tracking
- **ESA Framework (Phase 6 - COMPLETE):**
  - 134 Specialized Agents: 50 Page, 50 Algorithm, 8 Mr Blue AI, 16 Life CEO, 5 Marketing, 5 HR
  - 21 Active Agents: Operational and ready for task execution
  - 13 Certified Agents: MB.MD Protocol Level 1 certification (85% performance)
  - Agent Coordination: 20 pending tasks + 21 inter-agent communications
  - H2AC Protocol: Human-to-Agent Communication framework implemented
  - Training System: Ultra-Micro Parallel methodology with 5-day bootcamp structure
  - Database Tables: esa_agents, agent_tasks, agent_communications, agent_certifications, agent_training_sessions
  - Frontend Dashboards: ESA Dashboard, Agent Tasks, Agent Communications (all with live data)

**System Design Choices:**
- **MB.MD Protocol:** A foundational development methodology emphasizing simultaneous, recursive, and critical execution.
- **Agent-Driven Development:** Utilizes an ESA framework with a hierarchy of agents for parallel task execution and quality control.
- **Project Structure:** Organized into `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `docs/`, `attached_assets/`, and configuration files.

## External Dependencies

- **Database:** PostgreSQL (with Drizzle ORM)
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth (planned)
- **AI Integration:** Multi-AI integration (5 providers, including OpenAI for `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- **Payments:** Stripe (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`)
- **Real-time Communication:** Supabase Realtime (posts, messages, typing - planned integration)
- **Deployment & Hosting:** Vercel, Railway, Supabase (for platform independence features)
