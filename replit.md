# Mundo Tango

## Overview
Mundo Tango is a production-ready social platform designed to connect the global tango community. It features a resilient, self-sovereign architecture with enterprise-grade security, integrating with various business systems and specialized AI agents. The platform aims for monetization through premium services, event hosting, and targeted advertising, targeting a significant share of the global dance market.

## User Preferences
- Work Simultaneously - Run operations in parallel (use Promise.all, parallel tool calls)
- Work Recursively - Deep analysis, not surface-level (read imports, dependencies, related files)
- Work Critically - Target 95-99/100 quality (test before complete, validate edge cases)
- Check Infrastructure First - Use existing systems before building new (Page Audit, Auto-Fix, Agent Orchestration)
- Test Before Complete - Run E2E tests for UI changes, unit tests for backend
- Database: Never change ID column types (serial ↔ varchar) - breaks existing data
- Handoff Plan: Never deviate - Follow exact phase sequence
- Auto-Fix Maximization - All auto-fix as much as possible (3-attempt retry, <10% escalation rate)
- Validation Loop - observe → decide → act → validate → adapt (not just automation)
- MB.MD Methodology - Apply v9.9.2 patterns systematically: Research → Plan → Build → Test → Document

## System Architecture

### UI/UX
Mundo Tango utilizes an "MT Ocean Theme" with dark mode support via Tailwind CSS. Components are built with `shadcn/ui` and Radix UI, using Lucide React and React Icons for iconography. It supports 68 languages via `i18next` and Wouter for routing, with `AppLayout`, `DashboardLayout`, and `AdminLayout`. A Visual Editor enables inline editing. The navigation uses a Unified Sidebar with 27 icon-centric items across various sections. Standardized components like PublicProfileView, UnifiedSidebar, and PerRoleExperience ensure consistency.

### Backend
The backend is built with Express and TypeScript, using PostgreSQL (Neon) and Drizzle ORM. It features modular routes, JWT authentication with Google/Facebook OAuth, and an 8-tier RBAC system. Database migrations are automated, and server-side FFmpeg handles video transcoding. API endpoints support PRO tab functionalities, place recommendations, and enhanced Talent Match AI.

### AI Systems
An extensive AI ecosystem orchestrates 1,218 specialized agents hierarchically for tasks ranging from strategic oversight (Replit AI) to atomic execution. Key components include self-healing infrastructure, a production-ready validation loop, a Visual Validation Framework, contextual agent activation, a Backend Agent System, Mr. Blue AI Assistant, and a Bifrost AI Gateway for multi-provider AI interactions.

### Platform Features
Core features include social functionalities (events, groups, posts, notifications, media, live streaming, marketplaces, reviews) and business features (Talent Match AI, LIFE CEO AI, Multi-AI Orchestration, Automated Scraping, Admin Dashboard, Stripe Payments, and BullMQ Workers). New features include an Event Series System for recurring events, a redesigned City Groups Events Tab, RSS Feed Scraping, Profile Enrichment Service for LinkedIn/GitHub, an OpenStreetMap-based Geocoding Service, and Housing Friendship Closeness Integration. A Unified Messaging Inbox supports internal and external channels (Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp).

### Testing
The platform uses E2E tests, automated unit test coverage via CI/CD, and visual regression testing with Playwright and Claude Computer Use. The `run_test` tool is critical for E2E testing, handling environment setup and Stripe testing key injection.

### Production
Production leverages GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Prometheus/Grafana with Sentry for monitoring, Replit Publishing for deployment, Redis for caching, and PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM.

### Marketing Site Architecture
The marketing site includes a Donation Tier System, a Human to Agent Collaboration (H2AC) Volunteer Program, and an Ambassador Program, with all public statistics wired to a real database.

### Demo & Video Systems
A comprehensive Video Demo System (MB.MD Patterns 28, 38, 41) includes a landing page section with clickable demo cards, interactive modals, and a Playwright demo recording script. An automated video recording system uses Playwright's `recordVideo` to capture real customer journeys. All videos adhere to a ZERO fake data policy.
